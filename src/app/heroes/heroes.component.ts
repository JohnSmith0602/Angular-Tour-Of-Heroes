    /**************    Observable data    ************************
    The HeroService.getHeroes() method has a synchronous signature,
    which implies that the HeroService can fetch heroes synchronously.
    The HeroesComponent consumes the getHeroes() result as if heroes
    could be fetched synchronously.

    IMPORTANT NOTE: This will not work in a real application.
      You're getting away with it now because the service currently returns mock heroes. But soon the application will fetch heroes from a remote server, which is an inherently asynchronous operation.

/***********    Explanation - using/not using observable   *************

The previous version assigns an array of heroes to the component's heroes property. The assignment occurs synchronously, as if the server could return heroes instantly or the browser could freeze the UI while it waited for the server's response.

That won't work when the HeroService is actually making requests of a remote server.

The new version waits for the Observable to emit the array of heroes —which could happen now or several minutes from now. The subscribe() method passes the emitted array to the callback, which sets the component's heroes property.

This asynchronous approach will work when the HeroService requests heroes from the server.
